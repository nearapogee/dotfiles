Files owned and maintained by Matt Smith

You may use these files at your own risk. See included MIT-LICENSE.

Note: This README is a work in progress. Check back for updates or contact me
with any questions. I am adding more documentation to the config files. As
these are my personal dotfiles, they will change on my whim. I may try new
things, incorporate new features that may break other things, change defaults,
change key mappings, etc. Please make sure you are aware of the risks of using
these files!

Oh and, use VIM!


-Installation

Do: 'git clone git@github.com:matthewcalebsmith/dotfiles.git' in ~/bin. Then
you need to symlink the files to the appropriate locations. This means zshrc
=> ~/.zshrc, vimrc => ~/.vimrc, vim/ => ~/.vim, etc. Those are the minimum
files. A rake file will be coming in the near future for installation. You
will also need to install any dependencies you need. I would suggest:

rvm (from http://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm)
ruby >= 1.9.1
mvim >= 7.2 (from http://code.google.com/p/macvim/ if on a mac.)
git (via http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew)
ctags-exuberant (via http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew)
zsh - I use 4.3.9. (I have not gotten around to setting up bash.)

ruby gems:
  interactive_editor

Finally you need to do a 'git submodule init' and 'git submodule update'.
